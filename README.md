# App name

[APPNAME] is a chatroom in which you can communicate with body language, specifically made for Eric.

## About Eric

Eric is my tester. He is a designer and organizes design evening events.

He's in an electric wheelchair and has a lack of fine motor skills.

Eric is my tester and he is the one I'll be creating this application for. Eric wants to have an application in which he can communicates with body language in a chat. He has a motoric disability. He's in a wheelchair and has difficulties raising his arms and fine movements with his fingers. It was my duty to create an app for him according to his preferences and how he controls the application.

This was the user scenario I based my app on:

Eric is een ontwerper. Hij organiseert regelmatig design-avonden waar hij probeert om mensen met beperkingen samen te brengen met ontwerpers en makers. Eric zelf zit in een electrische rolstoel. Hij heeft niet de beschikking over de fijne motoriek. Hij heeft ooit met studenten van de minor Makers Lab gewerkt. Eric wilde zijn hele leven al gitaar spelen, maar zijn handen staan daar niet goed voor. Zijn team studenten heeft toen een werkend prototype gemaakt van een apparaat waarmee hij gitaar kan spelen.

5. Run the application by typing `npm run dev` in the terminal.
6. Go to `localhost:8000` in the browser and enjoy the app!

# Process

In this section I'll be talking more about my process:

## Body Language research

The only information we got was that Eric wants to have a chat in which he can communicate bodylanguage. To give myself inspiration, I looked up what different forms of communication are considered body language:

- Facial expressions
- Gestures (hand or arm movements, waving or shrugging)
- Posture
- Eye contact
- Tone of voice
- Touch
- Proximity (how close we stand can communicate intimacy, discomfort or dominance)
- Micro-expressions (brief, fleeting expressions that reveal our true emotions, often unconsciously)

## Ideas

I had a few ideas for this project before we could speak to our tester:

1. Create an avatar in the chatroom that can mimic the expression on the user's face. The user can use a camera or manually choose which expression to show. The avatar is able to make eye-contact with the user on the receiving end, but also with the user itself. These expressions will be measured by an AI.

If Eric doesn't likes it that his face is being tracked and wants to choose the body language manually, then I'll need a platform with small buttons which he actually can use, or try out the keyboard. If both of these won't work I can try the touchscreen of my laptop or use the trackpad. I can also try a drawing.

2. Make a chatroom in which he can create his own emoji's and adjust it's expression.

3. Whenever Eric writes in the chat, a suggestion for an emoji pops up.

4. He can create his own avatars to send in the chat, athough this might be too much effort for every message he would like to send.

### Testing

#### My prototype - week 1

For my first prototype, I just made a Figma document, because I didn't want to spent a lot of time building something and then stressing about not able to finish it within 1 day, without knowing if that's what Eric actually wants or mean with his assigment. So I just made it look how I wanted it to look like, to communicate my idea with him and I mostly wanted to ask if my idea was alright.

For testing I used my first idea. I just showed Eric my idea and he said that it's nice, but since it's only design, he cannot test it. At least now I know that Eric doesn't really have something specific he's looking for, so since the idea of using "body-language" within an app is very broad, it also CAN be very broad. With this feedback, I realized I can do a lot more than I basically had in mind.

#### Interview analysis - week 1

For our first interview, the group gathered around Eric and we all asked him some questions. These are my findings of the interview:

About Eric:

- Eric is 50 years old.
- He is in an electrical wheelchair.
- He is a condition in which certain muscles and tendons are underdeveloped and certain areas just grew in the opposite direction. The muscles he has, he is able to use them normally and good and he is also able to do most things others can do.
- He lives in a Fokus project. They offer rooms in a "normal" living area and it has a system in which he can press on buttons if he needs something that he cannot do himself, for example: standing up, putting on clothes.
- The problems of his issues are usually outside of his home, since the area isn't well adjusted to his conditions, for example: he cannot reach certain heights and therefore he cannot reach certain buttons which he MIGHT need to press.
- Eric has 2 jobs.
- He works with accesibility and is someone who works with mobility.
- He likes series, movies, games, board games mostly nowadays, DnD and listening to all sorts of music.
- He would like to learn sign language through an app, because he can't uses his fingers for that.
- He likes physical books the most, but because of his disability, he mostly reads on his phone.

Eric's devices:

- He uses "everything".
- He has a computer at home with a huge screen. He prefer this over smaller screens.
- He has two different phones he uses.
- His phone isn't too big, because it needs to be portable enough to carry around.

How Eric handles (his phone):

- Eric has a phone holder, but also uses his hands and arms to handle his phone.
- He handles his phone with a pen, so his hand won't block the screen too much.
- This pen works better on his Samsung or android phone than on his Iphone.
- After several uses, the pen's durability decreases. This means that it's less pleasant to use over time, so he gets a new one.
- When taking a picture, he need to use a timer, because he can't lift up his phone and press the button at the same time.
- He uses a pen for the phone keyboard.
- He uses the search function a LOT.
- When he uses emoji's, he is overwhelmed by the amount.
- When choosing an emoji, he usually ends up choosing whatever, because nothing fits his mood. Everything feels exaggerated.
- He doesn't always know what certain emoji's mean.
- He NEVER uses gifs or stickers, since the emoji's are already overwhelming on their own.
- He uses mostly the face emoji's and not food or other emoji's.
- Gallery app: he likes double tap to zoom in his screen.
- He can handle a mouse normally.
- He uses a keyboard with knuckles.
- He usually uses a wink face, heart emoji's, smileys and less sad or negative smileys.

Problems when Eric handles (his phone):

- When he handles his phone with his hand, most of the screen is blocked by the hand.
- He can grab his phone, but he can not lift it up too high.
- He can't reach the top of his phone so good.
- He can't/ it's difficult do 2 actions at the same time with his phone.
- He can't do multi finger gestures unless he uses his mac and tries to scroll (small surface).
- When he uses emoji's, he is overwhelmed by the amount.
- When choosing an emoji, he usually ends up choosing whatever, because nothing fits his mood. Everything feels exaggerated.
- He doesn't always know what certain emoji's mean.

What does Eric like or find pleasant or is able to do?

- He likes to use his pen on his phone, so his hand won't block the screen too much.
- He likes gestures, specifically swiping. He also likes to double tap. He doesn't need a pen for this.
- He uses the search function a LOT.
- He can scroll with multiple fingers on a toucpad (small surface).
- He can handle a mouse normally.
- He uses a keyboard with knuckles.

What are Eric's frustrations when handling devices?

- He finds it annoying to switch between different apps so often.
- He can't/ it's difficult do 2 actions at the same time with his phone.
- Half of the time, his fingerprint doesn't work.
- He doesn't like the overload of emoji's.
- He doesn't like that most emoji's are exaggerated, which means he often cannot find the corresponding emoji's that translates his feelings very well.
- Sometimes he chooses whatever emoji out of frustration.
- He doesn't know what most emoji's mean (keep in mind that this is usually also cultural except for facial expressions).
- He doesn't use sad emoji's or negative emoji's that often, as well as other emoji's tha don't express emotion. It's too much emoji's he can choose from.
- On the train, his phone moves too much and that means he cannot type.
- He would like it so that he can use the keyboard only, so he doesn't need to switch between keyboard and mouse.

Clearing some things up about the assignment:

- We don't have to create something FOR a chatting app on your phone, like Signal.
- He didn't have preferences for a specific color palette. I can do whatever I want with it.
- By adding more suitable body language, he wants to set the "tone of voice" in his messages.

Ideas I got from this interview:

- Certain locations or countries uses culturally different emoji's.
- Something like bitmoji's: if you're going quick, you see a car appearing on your bitmoji.

Things I would like to keep in mind:

- Make it fully accesible with only keyboard
- He only uses a handful of emoji's (anything that speaks positive body language)
- Make it so that he can switch between a normal keyboard and an old school keyboard with bigger buttons for on the train
- I want to add in so thathe can make his own facial expression on an emoji and just adjust the curve (maybe with a horizontal scale gesture).

#### My prototype - week 2

#### Interview analysis - week 2

## User Scenario

A user scenario gives us the context of the user. With the user scenario's you are able to identify different scenario's for the user in which they will use the app. This should give the designer information on how to design the app further. During different test sessions I have been able to identify different user scenario's for Eric:

User Scenario:

- Eric wants to be able to choose a corresponding emoji with his messages in a chatroom, so that he can find someting that will fit his message and he doesn’t needs to go through the trouble of finding a suitable one.
- solution: while he's typing a word, a suitable emoji's will be shown.

- Eric wants to be able to have better control of pressing the keyboard buttons, so that he can send messages when he's on the train and his phone moves too much.
- solution: creating bigger buttons that are easier to press, while also being able to press on every single button

- Eric wants to be in control of finding the right emoji in a chatroom, so that he can send an emoji's that translates the right feelings into his text messages.
- solution: creating his own emoji's or avatars.

- Eric wants to be control the application with keyboard only when he is using his computer, so that he doesn't needs to switch between mouse and keyboard, since it's less convenient for him.
- Solution: make the application keyboard accesible.
